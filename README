Design Overview: 
    General flowpath: 
        1. Main reads things in to the parser, line by line 
        2. the line parser function delimits functions/arguments based on newlines and semicolons and sends those functions to be ran (in RunFunctions()) 
        3. RunFunctions formats the command/arguments to be used in an exec function call. Each command is ran in the order given, sequentially.
    Important structures:
        1. pathvar holds current path at all times
        2. homedir variable getsthe user's home directory which is useful for certain commands
        3. inputArgs charecter array array (or string array) is important for all commands, it holds command name and any following arguments 


Complete Specification: 
    Whenever any incorrect or empty command is inputted, a error message displays command not found, and prints the command name if applicable
    we included lots of error checking in this code to avoid seg faults and misuse of system resources, some of this involves not running system calls unless needed
    We kept our code inside oen c file since all teh code is so interconnected, although this does retract from readability a little
    
Known Bugs or Problems: 
    when getting input argumenmts from a file certain arguments (especially those starting with -) will fail with a command not found error
    pipelining is not implemented
    alias command is not implemented
